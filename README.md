### An Android App for our college, Dr. KNMIET

Some questions we ask everyday, either to yourself or others.

> How many classes I need to attend in order to attain target attendance.

> What is next class?  What is syllabus of this subject.

This is the app that solves these problem.

- [ ] **Mess Timetable** - Similar implementations as of Timetable.
- [ ] **Syllabus** - Similar implementations as of Timetable.
- [ ] **Widgets** - Widgets for academic timetable and mess timetable.
