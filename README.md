### An Android App

Some questions we ask everyday, either to yourself or others.

> How many classes I need to attend in order to attain target attendance.

> What is next class?  What is syllabus of this subject.

This is the app that solves these problem.

####App is work in progress:

- [x] **Bunk Calculator** - Simple iterative algorithm.
- [x] **TimeTable** - Add JSON format of timetable for each section of each branch of each year and parse to get queried result and display to user.
- [ ] **Syllabus** - Add PDF Parser (Does that even exists?) to render syllabus of queried subject.
- [ ] **Notification** - Add Push Notification service.
